## Otis Vickers-Graver
I am a recent Makers graduate with strong communication, mentoring and people skills built during my time as a Youth Worker. I am looking for a Full Stack role in which I can continue learning new technologies whilst creating products that provide a valuable experience for users.

My journey to becoming a developer has been a hard-fought challenge that I have finally overcome. I am (and always have been) a big computer geek heavily involved with gaming, whizzing around the internet and fixing friends and families gadgets. However, I shied away from studying tech-related subjects in formal education as, funnily enough, I didnâ€™t see how something as fun as technology could be of any use in my future career.

After witnessing the rapid progression of technology, and realising that becoming a developer would be an exciting, future-proof career path full of continuous learning, I completed an immersive Web Development bootcamp at General Assembly in early 2018. Due to some sad personal circumstances, I was not able to translate this wonderful experience into a career. After these circumstances were resolved, I pressed on and was ultimately led to Makers which has equipped me to grow as a developer of the highest standard.



<!--I love how coding allows me to merge my logical thinking processes with my creative mindset. -->

## Skills

**I enjoy learning**

I love expanding my knowledge and stuffing new ideas into my brain - when studying I open my laptop with a wide grin and a few foot taps of excitement. This giddyness soon simmers down when I find a bug or run into something tricky, but solving these problems is the best part of this process as mistakes teach and help what I've learnt stick.


**Adaptive**

I'm not afraid of challenges and stepping outside of my comfort zone. 

**Mentoring**                             
I spent the majority of my time at Collage Arts mentoring young people. This included assisting them in finding work, getting them involved in social activities and teaching them new skills. I ran weekly screen-printing workshops in which I taught how to create t-shirt designs from scratch, spoke at about the importance of mentoring at a conference in Barcelona and was appointed as Youth Lead.

**Creative thinker**

Whenever I want to create something it's often because it doesn't exist yet, or that it does but a much better job could be done.

## Hobbies

I love anything to do with gaming, and can't wait for the release of Cyberpunk 2077.

I travel alot, and recently spent some time in Sydney, Australia which was an amazing experience and the furthest I've ever been from home.

I spend a copious amount of time organizing things, whether that be bookmarks, things in my house or my mind.
