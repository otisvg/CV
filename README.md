Hello! I'm a recent Makers graduate with strong communication, mentoring and people skills built during my time as a Youth Worker. I am looking for a Software Engineering role in which I can learn new technologies whilst creating revolutionary products that positively impact society.

I am (and always have been) big into computers, heavily involved in gaming, whizzing around the internet and fixing friends and families gadgets. However, I shied away from studying tech-related subjects in formal education. How could something as fun as technology be of any use in my future career? 

After witnessing the exponential progression of technology, and realising that becoming a developer would be an exciting, future-proof career path full of continuous learning, I completed an immersive Web Development bootcamp at General Assembly in early 2018. Due to some sad personal circumstances, I was not able to translate this wonderful experience into a career. After these circumstances were resolved, I pressed on and was ultimately led to Makers which has equipped me to become a developer of the highest standard.

## Technical Experience

**Makers Academy (Software engineering bootcamp)** (Sep 2020 - Dec 2020) 

Makers taught me how to teach myself skills that are extremely valuable within the tech industry. This included learning the importance of having a growth mindset, and being confident in picking up new languages and frameworks quickly and efficiently. A typical day consisted of inidividual learning in the mornings, and pair-programming with a different partner each afternoon. Object-oriented programming and test-driven development were at the core of all the work I did at Makers. Group projects were completed following Agile workflows with sprints, standups and retrospectives.

**Pirical (formerly Aspirant Analytics) - Software Engineer** (Jan 2019 - Mar 2019)

**General Assembly (Web development bootcamp)** (Nov 2017 - Mar 2018)

A JavaScript-focused bootcamp and the start of my working journey in becoming a developer. You can check out the projects I created whilst at General Assembly [here](https://codotis.github.io/).

## Soft Skills

**Adaptable**

Swiftly learning new technologies was a core part of my Makers experience. I built projects using Ruby, JavaScript, React, Sinatra and Ruby on Rails - to name a few. As a result, I’m able to pick up new languages and frameworks quickly and confidently by following strong developer processes. This includes learning languages by translation, following documentation, sourcing valuable learning resources online and following my own initiative.

**Communicator**

During my time working at Talent Match I managed a team of Youth Workers and provided one-to-one CV support to young people. This required constant communication, empathy and the aptitude to build friendships with a range of people. I also was a speaker at a youth conference in Barcelona, and ran creative workshops.

**Helper**

My training at Makers included learning about the importance of constructive feedback. To work on this, I asked for feedback at the end of each pairing session. I was frequently told that I'm patient, an excellent teacher and that I'm able to explain concepts both informatively and patiently.
