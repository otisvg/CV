## Otis Vickers-Graver


The constant evolution of technology has always made me desperately excited for what the future holds - likely technologies we can't even comprehend yet. I want to help build them! So, I am making a career change. To achieve this I am studying at Makers, a highly selective 16-week remote bootcamp that will help me realise my dream of building these technologies by putting me on the path to becoming a developer.

<!--I love how coding allows me to merge my logical thinking processes with my creative mindset. -->

## Skills

**I enjoy learning**

I love expanding my knowledge and stuffing new ideas into my brain - when studying I open my laptop with a wide grin and a few foot taps of excitement. This giddyness soon simmers down when I find a bug or run into something tricky, but solving these problems is the best part of this process as mistakes teach and help what I've learnt stick.


**Adaptive**

I'm not afraid of challenges and stepping outside of my comfort zone. 

**Mentoring**                             
I spent the majority of my time at Collage Arts mentoring young people. This included assisting them in finding work, getting them involved in social activities and teaching them new skills. I ran weekly screen-printing workshops in which I taught how to create t-shirt designs from scratch, spoke at about the importance of mentoring at a conference in Barcelona and was appointed as Youth Lead.

**Creative thinker**

Whenever I want to create something it's often because it doesn't exist yet, or that it does but a much better job could be done.

## Hobbies

I love anything to do with gaming, and can't wait for the release of Cyberpunk 2077.

I travel alot, and recently spent some time in Sydney, Australia which was an amazing experience and the furthest I've ever been from home.

I spend a copious amount of time organizing things, whether that be bookmarks, things in my house or my mind.
