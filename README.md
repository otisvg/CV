## Otis Vickers-Graver
Software Engineer

I am a recent Makers graduate with strong communication, mentoring and people skills built during my time as a Youth Worker. I am looking for a Full Stack role in which I can continue learning new technologies whilst creating products that provide a valuable experience for users and have a positive impact on society.

My journey to becoming a developer has been a hard-fought challenge that I have finally overcome. I am (and always have been) a big computer geek heavily involved in gaming, whizzing around the internet and fixing friends and families gadgets. However, I shied away from studying tech-related subjects in formal education as, funnily enough, I didnâ€™t see how something as fun as technology could be of any use in my future career.

After witnessing the exponential progression of technology, and realising that becoming a developer would be an exciting, future-proof career path full of continuous learning, I completed an immersive Web Development bootcamp at General Assembly in early 2018. Due to some sad personal circumstances, I was not able to translate this wonderful experience into a career. After these circumstances were resolved, I pressed on and was ultimately led to Makers which has equipped me to grow as a developer of the highest standard.

## Technical Experience

**Makers Academy (Software engineering bootcamp)** (Sep 2020 - Dec 2020) 

Makers taught me how to teach myself skills that are extremely valuable within the tech industry. This included learning the importance of having a growth mindset, and being confident in picking up new languages and frameworks quickly and efficiently. A typical day consisted of inidividual learning in the mornings, and pair-programming with a different partner each afternoon. Object-oriented programming and test-driven development were at the core of all the work I did at Makers. Group projects were completed following Agile workflows with sprints, standups and retrospectives.
